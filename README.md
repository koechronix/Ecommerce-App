## Mini-Ecommerce App
This is an simple mini-ecommerce app which is I can use to navigate around the homepage, 
and be able to filter products and categoricarically for men,electronics and all products but ***Buy now button*** is not functioning at the moment since the mini app project in in bulding process.
Also, the app is **fully responsive**

## About Development
### The mini-ecommerce app is still in ***BULDING IN PROGRESS*** ..........(worry not about button functionality of products )
So as to ensure we can be able to buy the products at our Ronix Shop...


# Also (backend)
The project uses db json to fetch data in which you can access and products ..
hence the bulding is ***progress***


## How Mini-Ecommerce App works
In visual studio code 
run the following commands to view the output;
In your terminal run 
 1. $ json-server --watch db.json --port 4000
  then open another terminal and run
 2.  $ npm start
  if there is problem run
