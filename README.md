## Title and Description
*** Ronix Shop***

## Mini-Ecommerce App
This is an simple mini-ecommerce app which is I can use to navigate around the homepage 
and be able to filter products and categoricarically for men,electronics and all products.

## About Development
### The mini-ecommerce app is still in ***BULDING IN PROGRESS*** ..........(worry not about button functionality of products )
So as to ensure we can be able to buy the products at our Ronix Shop...


# Also (backend)
The project uses db json in which you can access and add products manually following 
the structure that has been implemented in the database and after adding products 
you can go to the server and refresh the page and  products are  updated successfully according to the categories..


## How Mini-Ecommerce App works
In visual studio code 
run the following commands to view the output;
In your terminal run 
 1. $ json-server --watch db.json --port 4000
  then open another terminal and run
 2.  $ npm start
  if there is problem run
  3. $ npm install
